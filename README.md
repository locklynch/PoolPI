Calculating Pi with collisions

learnin' me some javascript codin' from the Coding Train youtube channel source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoW8g67XNxA

i still only understand like... half of what i'm doing, but i have a better grasp of the next things to start reading up to better understand every function, command, etc...

back to the boooooooks!


oh yeah, next few things i wanna do with this

1 - figure out how to change the dang color of the digits display! I gotta stop being a grump and learn more css and html
2 - figure out a way to make the collisions look/act smoother. They approach each other then just stick together until the calculations are done. It gets the right numbers but it looks lame
    - possibly look at other ways to approximate the actual physics other than timeSteps?
    - i also wonder what would happen if i made the blocks "solid" somehow, like, a function to not let them pass through each other, could use a variation on the velocity function... hmmm i'm wondering if that would mess with the fundimental math that i'm trying to do though. worth poking around at.

3 - i COULD rerender the wav file at a lower volume, lol, it's funny, but annoying after listening to it 4578905234079523409723509 times, but that's like breathing, so...
  - what i SHOULD do, is figure out how to turn down the volume of playback in the code (fuckin' balls, that's probably a css or html thing isn't it? boooooo! but okay)
4 - make a start/reset button (i bet i can cannibalize one from the Game of Life 2 project i have, piece it togehter from that)
5 - add an integer input option for the user to select how many digits of pi they want to calculate
6 - get over my damn self and learn the damn css and html to do things 1, 3, 4, and 5

i think that's it for nneeoowwww!
